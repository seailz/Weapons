# Weapons
This code is a bit of a mess, but it's a weapons plugin basically. 
<br>Created for my friend.<p>

I'm not gonna provide a jar for this plugin as it's mainley intended to be private, but it's pretty easy to get a jar anyway.

Weapons that are included in this plugin:
<ul>
  <li>
    Poseidon's Trident<br>ID: <b>trident</b>
    <br><br><b>Supports:</b> <ul><li>Trident</li></ul>

      <li>Right Click: Ice bubble - encapsulates yourself in a ball of ice for 5 seconds. 10 second cooldown</li>

    </ul>
  </li><br>
  <li>
   Enhanced Netherite Armor<br>ID: <b>netherite</b>   <br>No actions.
