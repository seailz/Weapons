# Weapons
This code is a bit of a mess, but it's a weapons plugin basically. 
<br>Created for my friend.<p>

I'm not gonna provide a jar for this plugin as it's mainley intended to be private, but it's pretty easy to get a jar anyway.

Weapons that are included in this plugin:
<ul>
  <li>
    Poseidon's Trident
    <br>Actions:
    <ul>
      <li>Right Click: Ice bubble - encapsulates yourself in a ball of ice for 5 seconds. 10 second cooldown</li>
      <li>Sneak: Ground Smash - smashes the ground and causes a mini explosion and some blocks to get thrown about, also launches nearby players back. <br>5 second cooldown.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
